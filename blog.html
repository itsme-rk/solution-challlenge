               <h3 style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: 15px; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">Climate Change Impact: <br>

                Annual Temperature Increase: <br>On average, global temperatures are rising at approximately 0.2 degrees
                Celsius per decade, contributing to more frequent and severe heatwaves. <br>

                Rising Sea Levels: Sea levels are rising at a rate of about 3.3 millimeters per year, leading to
                increased coastal erosion and threats to low-lying coastal areas. <br>

                Melting Ice: The Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass at an accelerating rate, contributing
                to the rise in sea levels and impacting ecosystems. <br>

                Extreme Weather Events: More frequent and intense extreme weather events, including hurricanes, floods,
                and wildfires, are occurring due to climate change. <br>

                Solutions to Climate Change:

                Renewable Energy Transition: Accelerate the shift to renewable energy sources like solar and wind to
                reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. <br>

                Reforestation and Afforestation: Planting trees on a large scale (reforestation) and creating new
                forests (afforestation) can absorb carbon dioxide, mitigating the impacts of climate change. <br>

                Energy Efficiency: Implement energy-efficient technologies and practices in industries, buildings, and
                transportation to reduce overall energy consumption. <br>

                Climate Resilience Planning: Develop and implement strategies for climate-resilient infrastructure,
                agriculture, and communities to adapt to the changing climate. <br>

                Global Cooperation: Strengthen international collaboration and agreements to address climate change
                collectively, with nations committing to emission reduction targets. <br>

                These solutions aim to address the causes of climate change and mitigate its impacts by fostering
                sustainable practices and global cooperation. <br>
